Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the makesoil.org website (the "Service") operated by MAKESOIL ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. And by agreeing to be bound by these Terms you also confirm your agreement with our Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any part of the Terms or Privacy Policy then you do not have permission to access the Service.

## Communications

By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.

## Purchases

If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.

The service may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.

## Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies

We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.

We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.

## Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service may be billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You may be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles may be set on a monthly basis.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription may automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or MAKESOIL cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting the MAKESOIL customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, may be required to process the payment for your Subscription. In such a case, you would need to provide MAKESOIL with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize MAKESOIL to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, MAKESOIL may issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

## Price and Fee Changes

MAKESOIL, in its sole discretion and at any time in any manner, may adjust or introduce new fees or pricing for any element of our Service. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

MAKESOIL would provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect would constitute your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

## Refunds

Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.

## Content

Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you post on or through the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

By posting Content on or through the Service, You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) that the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on a copyright.

You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for Content you or any third party posts on or through the Service. However, by posting Content using the Service you grant us the right and license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on and through the Service.

## Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by users), features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of MAKESOIL and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of MAKESOIL.

Since our incorporation on 9th March 2018, MAKESOIL has claimed a common law trademark over our logo, the name ‘MakeSoil™’ and the term ‘Soil Maker™’. This gives us legal protection should another individual or organisation, whether in the United States or elsewhere, imitate our logo, name or the term 'Soil Maker' without our prior written consent.

Links To Other Web Sites

Our Service may contain links to third party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by MAKESOIL

MAKESOIL has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites.

You acknowledge and agree that MAKESOIL shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such third party web sites or services.

We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third party web sites or services that you visit.

## Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account and/or any Soil Sites created or managed by you, and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.

If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

## Interactions With Other Users

You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Users. Our Service provide a platform for users to connect with one another, in order to make soil together at Soil Sites.

MAKESOIL is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other user, person or organization. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of our Service. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other users of our Service.

Remember, the MAKESOIL Service is just a platform that enables you to communicate and interact with other people in your neighborhood and around the world. We cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other MAKESOIL users, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Service.

We cannot and do not confirm each user’s identity. You are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Service. MAKESOIL does not represent or warrant that our Service is sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another user. Further, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Service. We do not investigate or verify any user’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information users may submit to the Service. We encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other users, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.

MAKESOIL users may organize in-person meetings and host events for other MAKESOIL users; however, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by MAKESOIL and users attend such meetings and events at their own risk.

Because our Service is merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

## User Conduct

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to act responsibly and exercise good judgment. In addition, you agree not to:

(a) use the Service in violation of any applicable law or regulation, including promoting or encouraging any illegal activity;
(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;
(c) use the Service in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Service in any manner;
(d) use our Service in connection with the distribution of spam (which we define as unsolicited bulk e-mail or any other unsolicited messages of a commercial, religious, romantic, political or other nature not within the intended purposes of the Service);
(e) stalk, intimidate, threaten or otherwise harass or cause discomfort to any other user of our Service;
(f) collect or store any information about any other member other than as permitted on our Service;
(g) use our Service for any commercial purpose whatsoever, unless with prior written consent from MAKESOIL;
(h) register for more than one member account;

(j) circumvent or attempt to defeat any security or verification measure relating to use of the Service;
(k) hold yourself out as an agent, representative, employee or affiliate of MAKESOIL, including but not limited to when you host an event for other MAKESOIL users; or
(l) assist any third party in doing any of the foregoing.

## Reporting Misconduct

If you interact with anyone through our Service who you feel is acting or has acted inappropriately, including but not limited to offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, who steals from you or engages in any other disturbing conduct, we strongly encourage you to immediately report such person to the appropriate authorities and to us by contacting us. Please note that although we encourage you to report misconduct, we are not responsible or liable for our users’ actions, and we are not obligated to take any action.

## Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless MAKESOIL and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, by you or any person using your account and password; b) a breach of these Terms, c) your violation of any rights of another, d) your conduct in connection with the Service, or e) Content posted on the Service. Further, if you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that such entity agrees to indemnify you and MAKESOIL for violations of these Terms in accordance with this Section..

## Limitation Of Liability

In no event shall MAKESOIL, nor its directors, employees, contractors, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

The above limitation of liability shall also extend to any ‘offline’ interactions that may take place between users of the Service. Such users are participating at their own risk.

Soil Makers - users of the Service who host and manage ‘Soil Sites’ (which may be located on their property) on the makesoil.org platform - shall not be liable for any loss, damage, injury, illness or death incurred by any ‘Soil Supporters’ participating in such Soil Sites. Nor shall Soil Supporters participating in Soil Sites be liable for any loss, damage, injury, illness or death incurred by any Soil Makers hosting and managing such Soil Sites.

If your Country of Residence is China these Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of China (“China Laws”).

If your Country of Residence is outside of the United States and China, these Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with Irish law.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.

## Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.
